<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
<br><br>
Whenever someone thinks of working on a new project which was already being developed by other people. The first thing we all have to do is go through the hard step of setting it up on our local machine.<br>
But who wants to waste their precious time in troubleshooting dependencies errors instead of working on something meaningful.<br>
To solve this problem docker comes into <a href="http://play.It">play.It</a> makes setting up your project so much easier with just one command and in my talk i will explain how.<br>
And if i ask you what happens if the project you are working on hits the internet with a BOOM! and you are getting tremendous amount of requests. But you have very limited amount of money to scale. What will you do?</p>
 <br>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong><br>
<br><br>
Attendees will learn the whole deployment process of python based applications and get a deep and thorough understanding of deploying python apps with docker and Kubernetes.<br>
